# AttackNHKPlan
New attack plans

War is the art of cheating. Thus, if you are capable, pretend inability; if you are prepared to enter
fight, pretend not to be; if you are close, pretend to be far away; if you are far away, pretend to be close. If he
enemy is greedy for profit, seduce him. If he's confused, catch him. If it's consistent, get ready. If it is powerful,
avoid it. If he's angry, provoke him. If he's humble, make him arrogant. If he's still, force him to act. If you are joined,
divide it. Attack him when he's not ready, jump on him when he's not expecting it. These formulas promote
victory to the strategists, but they cannot decide beforehand.
